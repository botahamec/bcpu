# bcpu
An emulator for a CPU with any instruction size. Made for experimentation

## Why?
This is mostly just an experiment with writing bitcode. I can't think of a practical use for this. It's probably going to end up being terribly slow, but in my defense, Java seems to work just fine, although it doesn't artificially slow itself down with aribtrary instruction sizes. Alas, I long for the day when CPUs will have this functionality. I'm not an engineer so there's probably a good reason why this will never happen.
